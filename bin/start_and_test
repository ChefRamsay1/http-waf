python3 api/api.py > /dev/null 2>&1 
# redirects program output to /dev/null which accepts and discards all input (produces no output)
# then we redirect error output as well by redirecting standard error (2) to standard out (1)
# this eliminates all prints from api.py optimizing our program for benchmarking

pytest ./tests
# we then call pytest on our test suite to perform unit tests and benchmarking
